## ULearn Physics
Responsive HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript revision site from scratch for NCEA L3 physics students. Works on all common devices in both horizontal and portrait orientation, and on Safari reader mode.
Development of the website initiated due to Rutherford College physics teachers coming and leaving in the past year, which has made it difficult for Level 3 students, due to the need to adapt to multiple teaching styles within the span of one year.

Full brief development and prototyping documentation available on request.

## ULearn PE
Group assignment and peer review platform proof of concept for the extension to make the ULearn revision site more interactive.

## TASC
Website for a potential Squash Club based at the Te Atatu squash courts. Full documentation and brief development also available.
