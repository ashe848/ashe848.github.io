# ashe848.github.io

Just started with GitHub, so stuff is slowly being added as I figure out how everything works here :)

Responsive HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript revision site from scratch for NCEA L3 physics students. Works on all common devices in both horizontal and portrait orientation, and on Safari reader mode.
Everything is made up, I haven't tried where the phone numbers actually lead to ;)
Full brief development and prototyping documentation available (on request).

This was based on my earlier (also made up) website for Te Atatu Squash Club http://abbyjshen.github.io/ (I also have full documentation)



I'm making this website because the Rutherford College physics teachers have come and left in the past year, which has made it difficult for Level 3 students, due to the need to adapt to multiple teaching styles within the span of one year.
