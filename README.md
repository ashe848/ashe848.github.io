## recent and legacy website code put together in 1 place

Responsive HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript revision site from scratch for NCEA L3 physics students. Works on all common devices in both horizontal and portrait orientation, and on Safari reader mode.
Everything is made up, I haven't tried where the phone numbers actually lead to ;)
Full brief development and prototyping documentation available (on request).

Reported issues: slideshow sometimes glitchy on Chrome (doesn't affect functionality, the transitions are just not as smooth), but is fine if refreshed.

This was based on my earlier (also made up) website for Te Atatu Squash Club (I also have full documentation)



I'm making this website because the Rutherford College physics teachers have come and left in the past year, which has made it difficult for Level 3 students, due to the need to adapt to multiple teaching styles within the span of one year.

I started this website in 2015 with the aim of making it go live, but unforeseeably, I fell out of love with actual physics content as the year went on, so the uploading of content will be much slower than what's said on the site. I'm still hoping to make this website as complete as possible, but it'll be during my spare time, which I don't look to have much of. So what do I do now? I found a better way to implement logic into my life - Software Engineering, which I now study at university.

I'll still be cleaning up the code here and making the coding of the website better as I learn new things, hopefully, my website will be launched, one day... some day...
